# Will Your YikYak Yak? 🔥

A Streamlit demo app that predicts whether a draft YikYak post will receive **high engagement** (top 10% of upvotes), using a **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** pipeline trained for a CSC 371 (Machine Learning) final project at Davidson College.

## Live App

## How it works
- You type a draft post.
- The app loads a pre-trained scikit-learn pipeline (TF-IDF vectorizer + Logistic Regression).
- It outputs a probability that the post lands in the “high engagement” class.
